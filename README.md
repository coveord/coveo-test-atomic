## Installation

To install or update, you just need to run:  
`npm i`

The gulp file will run automatically as a post-installation script, updating 
atomic to the latest beta (QA) version, copying assets from the package, and 
downloading the latest `index.html` from the ui-kit repo.

To force the latest Alpha (nightly) version, run:  
`gulp alpha`

Revert back to Beta (QA) version with:  
`gulp`

## Start server

Run local server with:  
`npm start`
